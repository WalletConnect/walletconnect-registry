# WalletConnect Registry Server

## Local development

The api is built with [next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

To build the site locally install nextjs.

```sh
npx create-next-app
# or
yarn create next-app
```

then

```sh
npm install next react react-dom
# or
yarn add next react react-dom
```

see the next website for more information on getting started [next.js getting started](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)

Then start the development server:

```sh
npm dev

#or

yarn dev
```

Then you have the site running locally at http://localhost:3000/

## Publishing

Merging to the production will automatically publish a new site.
